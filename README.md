I come up with a job interview assignment, I mock it up to keep confidentiality.

1. one hour to mockup assignment (dataset and requirement)
2. plan to do the assignment with sql server T-SQL

3. learned today: the compare git Fork vs Clone, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YQxkxw8nhE
4. would like to learn next: authentication via Token vs SSH or GPG Key

5. July18_command_lines.txt is a lot shorter and nicer, with experience gained from yesterday 
(repo: muxingyuan/uworks)

6. lesson learnt: write a README.md on github websit, hit commit button, but don't know how to push, 
there it got lost.
there is api way of retrieve it, but it is beyond my current exercise level.
need to form the habit of commit and push from local machine.

on the contrary, once .txt file pushed to remote, editting it from github website is valid.

so much to learn!
